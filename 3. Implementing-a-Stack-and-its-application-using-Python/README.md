# Implementing-a-Stack-and-its-application-using-Python
This repository will help us understand the abstract data type "Stack" and how to implement this data structure to solve real world problems. The following applications of stack have been shown here-
a) Reverse of a String
b) Balanced Symbol (parantheses) Algorithm
c) Base Converter (divide by base algorithm)
d) General Infix to Postfix conversion

    "that positioning in contiguous memory. So, if we can maingtain some explicit information in each item, namely the location of the next item, then the relative position of each item can be expressed by simply following the link from one item to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the location of the first item of the list must be explicitly specified. This is the latest node which is added to the linked list. Once, we know where the first item is, the first item can tell us where the second item is, and so on. The external reference is often referred to as the **head** of the list. Similarly the last item needs to know that there is no next item."

    "at any given hour. These students typically print up to twice during that time and the lengths of these tasks ranges from \n",
    "1 to 20 pages. The printer in the lab is older, capable of processing 10 pages per minute. The slower printing speed could\n",

    "As students submit printing tasks, we will add them to the waiting list, a queue of printing tasks attached to the printer.\n",
    "When the printer completes a task, it will look at the queue to see if there are any remaining tasks to process.\n",
    "Of interest for us is the average amount of time students will wait for their papers to be printed is equal to the average\n",
    "amount of time a task waits in the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, is the main simulation steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)  Create a queue of print tasks. Each task will be given a timestamp upon its arrival. The queue is empty to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)  For each second (currentSecond):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a) Does a new print task get created ? If so, add it to the queue with the currentSecond as the timestamp\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b) If the printer is not busy and the if a task is waiting-\n",
    "        i) Remove the next task from the print queue and assign it to the printer.\n",
    "        ii) Subtract the timestamp from the currentSecond to compute the waiting time for that task.\n",
    "        iii) Append the waiting time for that task to a list for later processing.\n",
    "        iv) Based on the number of pages in the print task, figure out how much time will be required.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    c) The printer now does one second of printing if necessary. It also subtracts one second from the time required for that task.\n",
    "    d) If the task has been completed, in other words the time required has reached zero, the printer is no longer busy.\n",
    "3) After the simulation is complete, compute the average waiting time from the list of waiting times generated."
